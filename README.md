**Percecption** is a fundamental requirement to any **autonomous** system - a car in this application. In order to successfully navigate the world such as be able to follow lanes, take turns, determine appropriate trajectory,etc., the autonomous car must be capable of **perceiving the world around** it. **Computer vision** techniques are used to achieve the self-driving-car's ability to **perceive the world**. 

In this project we will detect lane lines in images & vides from cameras using Python & OpenCV - a library that provides several useful computer vision tools for analyzing images & videos.
